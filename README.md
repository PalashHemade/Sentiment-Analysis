# Sentiment Analysis with Transformers

This project implements a **sentiment analysis** pipeline using a pre-trained transformer model from the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) library and PyTorch.

The model predicts whether a given text expresses a **positive** or **negative** sentiment.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Uses a transformer-based model for high accuracy.
- Tokenization and inference in **PyTorch**.
- Supports custom text input for quick sentiment prediction.
- Ready-to-run in Google Colab.
